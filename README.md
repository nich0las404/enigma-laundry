I am currently making a fully functioning app that takes alot of time
and while it might not be functional enough to be released in the real world
this project teaches me alot on how to seperate big files into small manageable parts
, while most of the functions are being built by chatgpt, i am grateful that i at least can understand
how it works on the surface lvl. I wish i can keep growing and become better from now on, i wish that this project can teach me alot of new and amazing things, implementing props, state, and components that i could not understand in theory but could be amazing in the future if i was able to utilize these skills in my daily life as a coder.
